# Comparing the Clinical Utility of the Dimensional and Categorical Models of Personality Pathology: Prediction of Treatment Outcome Trajectories in a Naturalistic Clinical Setting

The five-factor dimensional model of personality pathology has emerged from research efforts to
rectify some long-held concerns with the categorical classification of personality disorders. Despite its growing acceptance in the research community, widespread clinical implementation of such a dimensional approach requires further evidence of its clinical utility. Thus, the current study aimed to compare the clinical utility of the dimensional and categorical models of personality pathology in predicting individuals’ treatment outcome trajectories in outpatient psychotherapy. We first derived clients’ dimensional and categorical personality pathology profiles based on the DSM-IV personality disorder criteria assessed at intake. We then applied nonlinear mixed-effects modeling to clients’ (N = 249) session-wise treatment outcome data to identify the best-fitting shape (i.e., linear, quadratic, or cubic) of clients’ trajectories of change in each of the 12 treatment outcome domains. We then compared the performance of the dimensional and categorical models of personality pathology in predicting individuals’ treatment outcome trajectories over the course of psychotherapy. The results showed that the dimensional model outperformed the categorical model in predicting individuals’ treatment outcome trajectories in most outcome domains, especially in predicting the slopes (as opposed to intercepts) of treatment outcome trajectories. Further, the percentage of dimensional personality variables was greater than the percentage of categorical personality variables with regard to significant prediction for every clinical outcome examined. Overall, our results suggest that the dimensional model of personality pathology has better predictive clinical utility than the categorical model. We further explored these findings in greater depth and presented their potential application in real-world clinical settings in the discussion.
